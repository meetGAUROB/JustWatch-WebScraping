## Overview
This project aims to scrape JustWatch to gather information about movies and TV shows released after 2000. It then filters out movies and TV shows released before 2022 with an IMDb rating below 7. Finally, it generates word clouds for the top 5 streaming services and genres based on the filtered data.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to:

* Scrape 100 URLs of movies and TV shows released after 2000 from JustWatch.
* Extract data such as title, release year, genre, IMDb rating, and streaming services for each URL.
* Filter out movies and TV shows released before 2022 with an IMDb rating below 7.
* Generate word clouds for the top 5 streaming services and genres based on the filtered data.
